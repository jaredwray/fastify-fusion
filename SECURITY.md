# Security Policy

To report a security vulnerability, please post an issue in our repository for [fastify-fusion](https://github.com/jaredwray/fastify-fusion/issues) and mark it with `security vulnerability`. You need to add in the issue description the following information:

- **Vulnerability Type**: Describe the type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection).
- **Vulnerability Description**: Describe the vulnerability in detail, including how it can be exploited and what impact it may have.
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, provide a proof of concept (PoC) that demonstrates the vulnerability.

Once the issue has been validated, we will open a [Github Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/about-github-security-advisories-for-repositories), if necessary. When the issue has been resolved, we will alert users of the past vulnerability by publishing the security advisory.
